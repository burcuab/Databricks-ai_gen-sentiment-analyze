# Databricks-ai_gen-sentiment-analyze
Customer review sentiment analyzer and population of answers by Databricks ai functions

- I used the sample customer review dataset in Databricks and analyzed the sentiment of each customer review as positive, negative and mixed. Function is ai_analyze_sentiment(). 
- I created the answer for each customer review by using ai_gen() function.
